# Subscription Tracker

Simple, customizeable subscription point tracker for Twitch.

Tracks new subs, resubs, gift subs, and Twitch Prime subs.

Allows you to set the point values for each of Twitch Prime, tier one, tier two, and tier three subscriptions.

Writes point values to a simple text file that can be read by OBS (or not, that's up to you).

Great for subathons and events.
